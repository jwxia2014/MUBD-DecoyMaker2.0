# MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0

Introduction
-----------------------------------

MUBD-DecoyMaker is a Python GUI application to generate maximal unbiased benchmarking sets data sets for virtual drug screening. It can be run on Windows-based machine and has no dependency. 

Availability & Implementation
-----------------------------------

* Due to the large size, the Python GUI application has been uploaded to the cloud drives and is accessible from there：
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/x94fa20pze3aaed/MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0.exe?dl=0 (Outside China) or
  https://pan.baidu.com/s/15ZkrsXEHTNVv5XakW22PIA  (China)


Documentation
-----------------------------------

* The manual for the Python GUI application and the files for the case study are available at this website, i.e. 'manual.for.MUBD-Decoymaker2.0.pdf' and 'Case-ACM4-Agonists.zip'.


Installation
-----------------------------------

For users, we recommend them to run the Python GUI application on Windows-based machine, as all the dependencies have been included.  
For developers, they may send emails to jie.william.xia@hotmail.com or x.simon.wang@gmail.com to request the source codes. The source codes can be implemented on any platform. However, it should be noted that Python2.7 (64bits) and RDKit2013.03.2 (64bits) are required to install before the execution of the source codes.
