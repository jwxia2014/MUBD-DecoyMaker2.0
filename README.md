# MUBD-DecoyMaker 2.0

Introduction
-----------------------------------

MUBD-DecoyMaker is an easy-to-use computational tool to generate maximal unbiased benchmarking sets for virtual screening.
Unlike MUBD-DecoyMaker1.0, version 2.0 is developed with Python. Its GUI application can be run on windows and has no dependency. 

Availability & Implementation
-----------------------------------

* The source code for the Python GUI application is available at https://github.com/jwxia2014/MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0/MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0.py
* Due to the large size of the Python GUI application, it has been uploaded to the cloud drives and is accessible from there：
  


Documentation
-----------------------------------

* The manual for the Python GUI application is available at: https://github.com/jwxia2014/MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0/manual.pdf


Installation
-----------------------------------

For users, we recommend them to run the Python GUI application on windows, as all the dependencies have been included.  
For developers, they may implement the MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0.py on other platforms. It should be noted that Python2.7 (64bits) and RDKit2013.03.2 (64bits) are required to install prior to its use.
