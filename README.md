# MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0

Introduction
-----------------------------------

MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0, an updated version of MUBD-DECOYMAKER, is a Python GUI application to generate maximal unbiased benchmarking sets data sets for virtual drug screening. It can be run on Windows-based machine and has no dependency. 

Availability & Implementation
-----------------------------------

* Due to the large size, the Python GUI application has been uploaded to the cloud drives and is accessible from there：
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/dfa35t2jb0fnarx/MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0.exe?dl=0     (Outside China) or

Documentation
-----------------------------------

* The manual for the Python GUI application and the files for the case study are available at this website, i.e. 'manual.for.MUBD-Decoymaker2.0.pdf' and 'Case-ACM4-Agonists.zip'.


Installation
-----------------------------------

* We recommend the users to run the Python GUI application on Windows-based machines, as all the dependencies have been included. Please note we used the machine with Intel Core(TM) i7-7700 CPU@3.60GHz and RAM of 16 GB for testing the tool. The computation time for the test case of ACM Agonists was 1882 seconds.
